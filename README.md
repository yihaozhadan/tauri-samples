# Tauri Sample Applications

A collection of sample applications built with Tauri, demonstrating how to create cross-platform desktop applications using Rust and modern web technologies.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource for:
- Building desktop applications with Tauri
- Learning Rust programming in a practical context
- Understanding modern web development with frameworks like Svelte
- Implementing common desktop application patterns

## Sample Applications

### Memory Game
A classic card matching game that demonstrates:
- Window management and UI state
- Game logic implementation
- Responsive design principles
- Basic animations and transitions

### Markdown Editor
A markdown editor application showcasing:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Markdown parsing and rendering
- File management and navigation

### Calculator
A desktop calculator application showcasing:
- Basic UI layout and design
- Event handling and state management
- Mathematical operations in Rust
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Technologies Used

- **Tauri**: Core framework for building cross-platform applications
- **Rust**: Backend logic and native functionality
- **Svelte**: Frontend framework for reactive UI development
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server

## Getting Started

Each sample application is contained in its own directory with specific setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:

1. Install Prerequisites:
   - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Platform-specific dependencies for Tauri

2. Choose a sample app and navigate to its directory:
   ```bash
   cd memory-game
   # or
   cd calculator
   ```

3. Follow the README in each project directory for specific setup and running instructions.
